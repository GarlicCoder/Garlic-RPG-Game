## **Description**:
A short game where you must defeat the Evil Chef of Unseasoned Recipes in Garlic Town. Use your Garlic Tools and train at the local diner. 

## **My Process:**
I followed a Javascript tutorial from [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/learn-basic-javascript-by-building-a-role-playing-game/step-1) to create a video game with Javescript. I edited the text to change the storyline and also adjusted the CSS to my own liking!

**Coding Language**: HTML, CSS, Javascript
